The iNYU Bus application makes planning your next trip to and from an NYU dorm and NYU's Washington Square campus a breeze! You can also see all the scheduled bus routes for any day of the week in a simple and elegant way. Taking advantage of the iPhone's built-in GPS device, iNYU Bus will help you get to the closest bus route based on your location in New York City.
